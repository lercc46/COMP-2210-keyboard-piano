# summary
Hey there, this was an additional project that I did for COMP 2210 or Fundamentals of Computing II for honors credit at my university.
The GUI is not pretty, but it works nonetheless. 
I used a tutorial posted on Reddit for the sound synthesis but created all of the other methods and pygame GUI myself, including calculating frequencies for notes.

# contents
This repo contains two versions of the project as well as some files used for testing. "main.py" is the actual finished project source code that runs independently and "old_main.py" is the original version of the project that I abandoned because I came up with a new strategy.
